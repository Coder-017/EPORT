      <h1>IB MYP Design ePortfolio</h1>
      <p>
        This website presents a complete written guide to an IB Middle Years Programme Design ePortfolio,
        explaining what each criterion requires and how strong evidence can be organized through the full design cycle.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="about">
      <h2>About the Design ePortfolio</h2>
      <p>
        An MYP Design ePortfolio is a structured digital record of a student’s design process. Rather than showing only
        the final product, it documents the thinking, decisions, testing, and reflections that lead to the product.
        In the MYP curriculum, this matters because design is assessed as a process of inquiry and iteration, not just
        an outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        The portfolio should show clear progression through four stages. <strong>Inquiry and Analysis (Criterion A)</strong>
        establishes the problem, context, and research base. <strong>Developing Ideas (Criterion B)</strong> converts
        research into specifications and justified design options. <strong>Creating the Solution (Criterion C)</strong>
        demonstrates planning and technical execution. <strong>Evaluating (Criterion D)</strong> measures success,
        explains impact, and identifies realistic improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        A strong ePortfolio is coherent, evidence-based, and explicit about why decisions were made at each stage.
        It should read like a design argument supported by data, not a collection of disconnected artifacts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="criterion-a">
      <h2>Criterion A: Inquiry and Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Criterion A focuses on understanding the problem before generating solutions. Students should begin with a
        clear explanation of the design situation: who the user is, what need exists, and why that need matters.
        The problem statement must be specific enough to guide design choices later.
      </p>
      <h3>What to Include</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A precise design problem statement connected to a real context</li>
        <li>Description of the target user and relevant constraints</li>
        <li>Primary research, such as interviews, surveys, and observations</li>
        <li>Secondary research, such as articles, case studies, and technical references</li>
        <li>Analysis of existing products, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and gaps</li>
        <li>A reasoned justification for choosing this problem as the project focus</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Quality Expectations</h3>
      <p>
        High-level responses do not just list research findings. They interpret evidence and explain how it influences
        the direction of the project. Students should show source reliability, compare conflicting findings, and make
        clear decisions based on insight rather than assumptions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="criterion-b">
      <h2>Criterion B: Developing Ideas</h2>
      <p>
        Criterion B is about transforming research into actionable design thinking. Students define measurable design
        specifications and generate multiple concepts before selecting a final direction.
      </p>
      <h3>What to Include</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A detailed design specification derived directly from Criterion A findings</li>
        <li>Multiple concept ideas showing variety in form, function, or mechanism</li>
        <li>Annotated design communication that explains key features and decisions</li>
        <li>Justification for the selected concept using criteria-based comparison</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Design Specification Guidance</h3>
      <p>
        Specifications should be testable. For example, instead of writing "easy to use," students should define what
        usability means in measurable terms, such as setup time, number of steps, or user error rate. Strong
        specifications include functional, ergonomic, aesthetic, environmental, and safety requirements.
      </p>
      <h3>Quality Expectations</h3>
      <p>
        The best Criterion B work shows clear iteration. Students should demonstrate that ideas evolved through
        critique and comparison rather than selecting the first concept generated.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="criterion-c">
      <h2>Criterion C: Creating the Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Criterion C evaluates how effectively students turn plans into a real solution. The emphasis is on process
        control, technical competence, and faithful implementation of the intended design.
      </p>
      <h3>What to Include</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A logical production plan with sequencing, timing, and checkpoints</li>
        <li>Justification of materials, tools, and techniques</li>
        <li>Evidence of safe working practices and quality control decisions</li>
        <li>Clear process documentation of key stages and adjustments</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Production Process Guidance</h3>
      <p>
        A strong process record explains not only what was made, but why changes were introduced. If a step failed or
        produced an unexpected result, students should document the issue, adaptation, and impact on final quality.
        This demonstrates authentic technical decision-making.
      </p>
      <h3>Quality Expectations</h3>
      <p>
        Top responses connect final output quality back to planning discipline. Evidence should show that decisions in
        materials, assembly, and sequencing were intentional and aligned to specifications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="criterion-d">
      <h2>Criterion D: Evaluating</h2>
      <p>
        Criterion D asks students to judge the effectiveness of their final product using evidence. Evaluation must be
        grounded in the original design specification and supported with test data and user feedback.
      </p>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion-item open">
          <button class="accordion-btn">Evaluation Against Design Specification</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>
              Students should evaluate each specification point individually and state whether the final product meets,
              partially meets, or fails to meet that requirement, using concrete evidence.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-btn">Improvements and Next Iteration</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>
              Suggested improvements must be realistic and prioritized. Strong responses explain the expected effect of
              each change on performance, user experience, and feasibility.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-btn">Impact Analysis</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>
              Students should discuss user impact and broader implications, including accessibility, environmental
              footprint, durability, and long-term use context.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="research">
      <h2>Research and Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        This section captures the evidence base that informs design decisions. Research should include user voice,
        contextual insight, and critical analysis of existing solutions.
      </p>
      <h3>Recommended Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Summary of key user needs discovered through primary research</li>
        <li>Comparison of existing products and identification of unaddressed gaps</li>
        <li>Synthesis of secondary research into practical design implications</li>
        <li>Short rationale showing how findings shaped specification priorities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Inspiration in a text-focused portfolio can be expressed through concept statements, design principles,
        material strategy notes, and references to successful product features that inform the final direction.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="prototypes">
      <h2>Prototypes and Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Prototyping demonstrates iterative refinement. Each prototype version should have a clear objective,
        corresponding test method, and a documented result that drives the next change.
      </p>
      <h3>What to Explain for Each Prototype</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Purpose of the prototype and what assumption it tested</li>
        <li>Testing conditions and success criteria</li>
        <li>Observed performance and user responses</li>
        <li>Specific improvements made before the next iteration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Effective testing includes both technical checks (stability, durability, safety, precision) and usability checks
        (comfort, clarity, ease of interaction). Reporting should connect directly to specification points.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="reflections">
      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        Reflection should show growth across the project, not just a final opinion. It should identify what changed in
        your design thinking, how challenges were managed, and which skills improved through practice.
      </p>
      <h3>Useful Reflection Prompts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How did research change my initial assumptions?</li>
        <li>What design decision had the biggest effect on outcome quality?</li>
        <li>Which challenge required the most adaptation and why?</li>
        <li>What would I do differently if I repeated this project?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Strong reflections reference specific project evidence. Instead of general statements like "I improved time
        management," explain what planning strategy was adopted and how it changed progress or quality.
