      <h1>IB MYP Visual Arts ePortfolio</h1>
      <p>
        An IB MYP Visual Arts ePortfolio is a structured written record of artistic growth. It documents how ideas are
        researched, interpreted, developed, and evaluated through visual language. The portfolio is not only a summary of
        finished outcomes; it is a critical account of learning decisions, conceptual development, technical refinement, and
        reflective judgment across the creative process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The portfolio aligns with the four MYP Arts criteria. Criterion A demonstrates command
        of artistic vocabulary, visual analysis, and contextual awareness. Criterion B explains growth in
        technique, media handling, and material control. Criterion C documents concept building,
        experimentation, and compositional decision-making. Criterion D evaluates final outcomes through
        evidence-based reflection and clear connection to artistic goals.

    <section id="task1" class="section-block">
      <h2>Task 1 — Criterion A: Knowing and Understanding</h2>
      <h3>Artistic Terminology, Elements, and Principles</h3>
      <p>
        Criterion A requires precise use of visual arts terminology and conceptual understanding of how formal elements create
        meaning. Line may define contour, direction, tension, or rhythm. Form and shape establish structure and spatial
        presence. Colour communicates atmosphere through hue, value, temperature, and saturation relationships. Texture
        influences tactile and visual perception, while tone controls depth and emphasis through light and shadow.
      </p>

      <h3>Cultural and Historical Context</h3>
      <p>
        Visual practice is always situated in context. Artistic styles emerge through historical conditions, philosophical
        ideas, technological change, and cultural identity. Contextual understanding requires identifying influences with
        specificity: period, place, movement, and conceptual intent.
      </p>

      <h3>Communicating Meaning Through Visual Language</h3>
      <p>
        Meaning in visual art is created through relationships among elements rather than isolated features. High contrast can
        direct attention and suggest conflict. Repetition can create rhythm and continuity, while asymmetry may generate
        instability or tension. Strong analysis connects such formal decisions to emotional and conceptual impact.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="task2" class="section-block">
      <h2>Task 2 — Criterion B: Developing Skills</h2>
      <h3>Technical Growth and Material Control</h3>
      <p>
        Criterion B documents how practical ability develops through disciplined experimentation and revision. Technical growth
        includes more consistent line confidence, improved tonal transitions, clearer edge control, stronger compositional
        planning, and greater precision in layering or blending.
      </p>

      <h3>Experimentation and Refinement of Method</h3>
      <p>
        Skill development in visual arts is iterative. Effective practice involves testing alternatives, comparing outcomes,
        and refining methods based on evidence.
      </p>

      <h3>Challenges and Improvement Over Time</h3>
      <p>
        Strong reflection identifies causes, evaluates corrective strategies, and explains measurable progress across stages.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="task3" class="section-block">
      <h2>Task 3 — Criterion C: Thinking Creatively</h2>
      <h3>Inspiration, Concept Development, and Refinement</h3>
      <p>
        Criterion C focuses on how creative intention is formed and transformed. Process begins with thematic stimulus,
        then advances through experimentation, selection, and clarification of concept.
      </p>

      <h3>Compositional Decisions and Intention</h3>
      <p>
        Decisions about scale, focal point, negative space, directional flow, and hierarchy influence interpretation.
        Artistic intention should guide these choices consistently.
      </p>

      <h3>How Creative Choices Strengthened Outcome</h3>
      <p>
        Creativity is demonstrated through intentional problem-solving. Strong analysis evaluates how selected choices improved
        coherence, communication, and alignment between concept and execution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="task4" class="section-block">
      <h2>Task 4 — Criterion D: Responding</h2>
      <h3>Evaluation of Final Artwork</h3>
      <p>
        Criterion D requires critical evaluation of how effectively the final artwork fulfilled its intention. Reflection
        should assess technical quality, conceptual clarity, compositional coherence, and expressive impact.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience Interpretation and Communication</h3>
      <p>
        Responding includes examining how viewers may interpret the work and comparing intended meaning with perceived cues.
      </p>

      <h3>Future Development and Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Strong responses conclude with prioritized next steps linked to evidence from process and outcome.
